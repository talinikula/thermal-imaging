# Thermal Imaging

Thermal camera shows surface temperature of the object. The emissivity of the object affects greatly to the measured temperature. Typically matt surface objects (timber, concrete etc.) have emissivity around 0.95 which means that they absorb and emit 95% of the inbound heat radiation.  Uneven or coarse surface or just dust on the surface will have an effect on the emissivity value. The shiny metal surface are opposite of matt surface in regards of emissivity. Shiny objects usually have emissivity of 0.05, so they act like a mirror to thermal radiation and rather reflect temperature of the surrounding objects than their own. This means that they show in thermal image false temperature. Concave surfaces with moderate emissivity values can be problematic because the surface radiates to itself resulting higher temperature value on thermal image. So be wary with those shiny objects.

Categorizing thermal images based on the damage type

Images taken with thermal camera can show different patterns of heat distribution and different type of damages can be categorized. This repo will be used to gather basic types of the damage cases with short desciption of the cause and solution to the problem in question.
